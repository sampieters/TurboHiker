# The Flash Turbohiker

A turbohiker game made by Sam Pieters for the advanced programming course of the University of
Antwerp.

## 1) Compiling & Running

``` ./run.sh```

## 2) Gameplay

The Flash has some problems! The strongest enemies have come togheter to destroy Barry Allen
and claim the title of the fastest man alive! Can you help The Flash to get rid 
of these monsters and save Central City once again?
 
### 2.1) Controls
Some simple controls are implemented.

#### Moving
Use 'w' for going up, 's' for going down and 'a' for going left or 'd' for going right.

#### Yelling
Are the dangerous monsters in the way? Simply use the space bar to let them know wiht a strong voice
that they are nothing to you! Be careful because even though you yell, you have to 
wait some time to yell again.

## 3) Goal
The goal of the game is to win the race and become the fastest man alive once again! Hurry up though
because the opponents will try everything they can to stop you. If u want a harder challenge, you
can try to score the highest score on the leaderboard (this will surely impress Iris West ;-) ).

## 4) Difficulty
Is the game to easy? Or do you wanna change some things? Try the following things in the CONST.h file.

### 4.1) Player
Change the players properties like speed, the sentence you yell, the size, etc...

### 4.2) Enemies
Do you wanna change all the enemy types or just one? Both are possible! Try changing some properties like their
speed or their chance to move when you yell at them. These two options surely will
make the game harder.

### 4.3) World
Don't you like changing the entities, than maybe try the world? The game is made such that the size of
the world and the amount of the lanes in the world can be changed. Note that when you change
the amount of lanes, the enemies will be gathered over a more wider area which will make
the game easier. If you want the same or a higher difficulty, you can change the amount of entity types
there will be initialized.

## 5) Spefications of code
The spefications of the code can be found in the doxygen. Simply go to the following [link](index.html). If the link
doesn't work, you can simply go to the index.html file in the same folder as you found the README.


**HAVE FUN PLAYING!**
